                "THE MOST IMPORTANT thing here is not to use any of the blowfish whatsoever, since every single part of it is deadly in a very unpleasant way. After covering all work surfaces, dispose of the blowfish very carefully. Better yet, get someone else to dispose of the blowfish, preferably someone you don't like very much but who doesn't owe you any money. An incinerator would be an ideal place, provided the smoke is blowing in the direction of unnecessary people.", "Check the fish for any scales or bones and remove any you find. Place in a colander and quickly pour boiling water over it, then immediately plunge the fish into a bowl of cold water; the object is not to cook it but to make sure it is clean.", "Finely slice the radishes and spring onion (lengthways) and arrange into pretty patterns on two plates, along with the watercress.", "Using a very sharp knife, carefully slice the fish as thinly as possible.", "Serve immediately, with the soy dip."

            "notes": ["You might ask why bother to obtain a deep-sea blowfish at all? If you do not, the dish will still be very pleasant but will not have that delicate frisson which lifts the dish to gastronomic heaven.", "Connoisseurs claim they can tell by the taste if a blowfish has been anywhere near the kitchen on the day of preparation.", "Some wizards reckon that the blowfish business is a bit like that idea that water remembers what’s been in it.", "People know the dish is a genuine blowfish dish when they’ve been charged $100 for it."]
